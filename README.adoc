= Camunda Cache Example

This example create a simple BPMN process and listen to
History Events. When the event belongs to a task it
will try to fetch the task and put it into the cache.

Start with

    ./gradlew bootRun

then open http://localhost:9090/app/tasklist/

== Cluster

Using docker you can create a clustered environtment.

=== Build Docker Image

[source,bash]
....
./gradlew dockerBuildImage
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --scale frontend=2
....

You can then open Camunda at http://localhost:9090/app/tasklist

The port number may change as docker-compose assigns them in the range of http://localhost:909[0-9]/app/tasklist

Also the Hazelcast Mancenter is availible: http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter/cnote

At the first step you have to create a user in the Mancenter.
